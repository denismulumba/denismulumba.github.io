**SIAM-Published Article**  
**Title:** Impact of Soil Hydraulic Parameter Variability on Soil Moisture: An Empirical Orthogonal Function Analysis 
**Published:** February 6, 2025  

**Summary:**  
This article delves into the complexities of soil hydraulic parameters and their impact on soil moisture simulations. By employing EOF analysis, the study uncovers dominant modes of soil moisture variability and assesses the influence of different soil parameterization schemes. The research underscores the challenges in accurately modeling soil moisture due to inherent uncertainties in soil properties and emphasizes the importance of improving parameter representations in land surface models.

**Boise State University Research Highlight**  
**Title:** Efficient Analysis of Large Climate Datasets  
**Published:** November 29, 2023  

**Summary:**  
This article highlights research by Kachinga Silwimba and Alejandro N. Flores on improving the efficiency of analyzing large climate datasets. They combine climate model emulation with Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis to reduce computational costs and improve performance. Their work uses simulations from the Community Land Model Version 5 (CLM5) and leverages high-performance computing (HPC) tools like Python, Bash, and statistical software. The team applies EOF to identify key patterns in climate data, making analysis faster and more scalable.
