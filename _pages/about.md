## About Me

I am a data scientist and machine learning specialist with over three years of experience applying high-performance computing (HPC) and advanced analytics to climate modeling and geospatial data challenges. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Computing (Data Science) at Boise State University, where my research focuses on machine learning for climate and hydrological modeling with an emphasis on uncertainty quantification and interpretability. I have a proven track record of leveraging Python-based deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) to improve predictive accuracy and computational efficiency in large-scale simulations. As a published author and presenter at international conferences, I am passionate about bridging scientific research and practical solutions – using data-driven methods to advance climate science while optimizing HPC and data engineering workflows for real-world impact. I thrive in interdisciplinary teams and value collaborative, reproducible research, demonstrated by my work integrating climate science domain knowledge with modern AI techniques and scalable computing infrastructure.

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning Emulators for Climate Models**  
  I develop deep learning surrogates (e.g., CNNs, LSTMs) to emulate complex climate simulations such as CLM5. These models significantly reduce computational costs while maintaining physical fidelity, enabling faster and scalable climate scenario analysis.

- **Uncertainty Quantification & Interpretability**  
  I apply evidential deep learning to quantify prediction uncertainty in climate and hydrological models. Tools like SHAP and Sobol indices help ensure that model outputs are transparent, interpretable, and scientifically robust.

- **Geospatial Pattern Analysis**  
  My work involves identifying and analyzing spatial climate patterns using machine learning and statistical techniques. I implement scalable workflows using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) and Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) in Python/Dask to detect anomalies and validate climate models.

- **High-Performance Computing (HPC) & Big Data**  
  I optimize environmental data workflows on multi-node GPU-accelerated clusters using tools like Dask, Xarray, Docker, and Singularity. This includes efficient job scheduling, parallel processing, and large-scale data engineering for climate and Earth system modeling.

- **Hybrid Climate Modeling with AI**  
  I explore integrated modeling approaches that combine physics-based climate models (e.g., CLM5, WRF) with machine learning. This hybrid methodology improves prediction reliability and supports actionable insights for climate mitigation and decision-making.
